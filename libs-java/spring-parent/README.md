# Spring-based microservices shared parent

- No dependencies, just unification of versions and required list plugins
- Allows to to keep our number of technologies at minimum, so having one base project for all services looks as a good idea.

Please use the project as base project for new microservices, and update them to the latest parent version so that we may limit number of choosed technologies and keep them in the same (or similar) versions.
