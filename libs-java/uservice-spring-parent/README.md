# Spring-based microservices shared parent

- Designed to be a parent project for main pom in multimodule Âµservice project
- No dependencies, just unification of versions and required list plugins
- Allows to to keep our number of technologies at minimum, so having one base project for all services looks as a good idea.

Please use the project as a parent project for all java spring-based microservices, so that they can be kept in the same (or similar) version of libraries and plugins.
